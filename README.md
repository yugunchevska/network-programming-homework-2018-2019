# How to submit the homework

In order to submit your homework you must have github account. If you don't have github account you have to create one. Next you have to download the version control system - GIT.
You can do it from the official web site https://git-scm.com/downloads. 

After you did the aforementioned steps you are ready to proceed.

In order to create copy of the repository you should **fork** (Click Fork button in the top right corner) the repository.  By forking the repository you allow me to view the history of your work. (**Uploading the whole project functionality at once will count as cheating**).

Now after you have copied the repository you can download it locally and start working on the task you have choosen.

In order to download the project locally you need to use the following command:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/network-programming-homework-2018-2019.git

Inside the repository you forked, create a file named with your faculcy number. For example **81XXX**.

Your source code should be in package **com.fmi.mpr.hw.chat** or **com.fmi.mpr.hw.http** depending on the task you have choosen.

For more information how to upload code from your local repository to the master repository you can use the following link https://git-scm.com/docs.

The end date of the homework is: **02 January 2019**.
